### Files of book
The structure of the kindle highlights file is 

```
ï»¿{{title}} ({{author}})
- {{metadata}}
{{content}}
==========
```

This program make a file  for every title found in the file and append the notes to that

### Duplicate note
If the content of a note is inside in the content of the nextone (or viceversa) only the latest one will keept. This is made because if you modify an already taken note on kindle it doesn't remove the old one but just add the newer.

### Modify a file
You could modify a file, for example delete a note or add a comment, and it will not be overwritten the next time you run the programm. This is very useful if you had to modify the structure. For example if you use this inside an app like Obsidian you'd like to append link in a file.

To do this the progra use an hidden file with the date of the last note append. The file will be created in the destination directory if doesn't found and it's named `.support.txt`
